# NOTE:
# The following submodules point to proprietary (non-open-source) components of the original
# flexiWAN SaaS offering. They are kept here ONLY for reference so that forks understand the
# original structure. They are NOT required to run the open backend + the newly developed
# open React UI located in ./frontend (project name: OpenSource-OpenNetworking).
#
# If you do not have access to these private repositories you can safely ignore the
# submodule initialization errors or comment out these sections entirely.

# The legacy top-level 'client' directory (empty in this fork) has been removed as part of cleanup.
