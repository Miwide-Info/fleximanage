### 📊 Architecture

```
Internet ←→ FlexiManage Frontend (React) ←→ Backend API (Node.js)
                                                    ↓
                                    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
                                    ↓               ↓               ↓
                              MongoDB         Redis Cache    SMTP4Dev
                            Replica Set     (Session Store) (Email Test)
                           (3 nodes)
```

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Access the application**: https://localhost:3443
2. **Register users**: Use the registration API or web interface
3. **Check emails**: View at http://localhost:8025
4. **Monitor services**: Use `docker compose logs -f`

The FlexiManage system is now ready for SD-WAN device management and network configuration!
